@warning These instructions are no longer up-to-date.  Using vcpkg was causing too many problems since it doesn't build
OpenCV correctly.  (For example, vcpkg doesn't build highgui or the video plugins required to import video files.)  For
this reason, building with vcpkg is no longer supported.  See the build instructions on the DarkHelp project page instead.


# -------------------------
# SETTING UP PRE-REQUISITES
# -------------------------

Install Visual Studio 2019 from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/
During installation, select "Desktop development with C++".
Download and install WinGet from https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases
Run the following commands:

	winget install git.git
	winget install kitware.cmake
	winget install nullsoft.nsis


# ----------------
# CUDA/CUDNN & GPU
# ----------------

If you only want the "CPU" version of OpenCV and Darknet, then skip to the next section called "BUILDING OPENCV & DARKNET".

If you want to use your CUDA-supported GPU with Darknet and DarkHelp:

	- Visit https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
	- Click on Windows -> x86_64 -> 10 -> exe (network) -> Download
	- Accept the defaults and finish the CUDA install.
	- At the end of the next section, the installation command you run needs to be the one that includes CUDA/CUDNN support.


# -------------------------
# BUILDING OPENCV & DARKNET
# -------------------------

Run the following commands:

	mkdir c:\src
	cd c:\src
	git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
	cd vcpkg
	bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
	vcpkg.exe integrate install
	vcpkg.exe integrate powershell

Run *ONE* of the following two "install" commands:

	- This one is if you have a supported GPU and CUDA:
		vcpkg.exe install --triplet x64-windows-static tclap cuda cudnn opencv-cuda darknet[cuda,cudnn,opencv-cuda]

	- This one is if you only want support for CPU:
		vcpkg.exe install --triplet x64-windows-static tclap opencv darknet[opencv-base]

Note the install command will take some time to run since it has to download and build OpenCV, Darknet, and various dependencies.

Once it has finished, you can free up some disk space by deleting these two subdirectories:

	rmdir /s /q buildtrees downloads


# -----------------
# BUILDING DARKHELP
# -----------------

Download DarkHelp from https://www.ccoderun.ca/
Extract the source into c:\src\DarkHelp\
Run the following commands:

	cd c:\src\DarkHelp\
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:\src\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=c:\src\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows-static -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static ..
	msbuild.exe /property:Platform=x64;Configuration=Release /target:Build -maxCpuCount -verbosity:normal -detailedSummary DarkHelp.sln
	msbuild.exe /property:Platform=x64;Configuration=Release PACKAGE.vcxproj

This will build a static library named "darkhelp.lib", and the "DarkHelp.exe" command-line tool.

See build_windows.cmd which contains the steps from "BUILDING DARKHELP".
